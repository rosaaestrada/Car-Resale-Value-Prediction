# Car Resale Value: Prediction & Key Influencing Factors

## Purpose
This project explores whether the resale value of a car can be accurately predicted using features like brand, age, mileage, fuel type, and more, while also uncovering which attributes contribute most to price depreciation.

## Questions Answered:
- Can we predict the optimal selling price of a car?
- What factors influence resale value?
- Which brands hold their value best?
- Do automatic cars depreciate faster than manual ones?
- Does high mileage equal lower price?

## Summary of Key Insights:
- üîß Present price, car age, and brand are the strongest predictors of resale value.
- üìâ Automatic cars depreciate faster than manual ones, losing more value on average.
- üöó High mileage has little predictive power on resale price in this dataset (correlation ‚âà 0.03).
- üèÜ Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression and XGBoost, achieving the highest accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.72).
- üí∞ Brands like Vitara Brezza and Bajaj Avenger retained over 90% of their original price, signaling strong demand and low depreciation.
